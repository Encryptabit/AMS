# Project State

## Project Summary
[IMMUTABLE - Copy verbatim from PROJECT.md on creation. Never edit this section.]

**Building:** Comprehensive audit and refactoring initiative for the Audio Management System (AMS) — achieving complete, ground-truth understanding of every line of code

**Core requirements:**
- Complete call graph exists for every file (including FFmpeg/P/Invoke code manually documented)
- Pipeline flow documented with precise step order and data flow
- Every file has a clear purpose documented
- Dead code identified and catalogued
- Consolidation opportunities identified

**Constraints:**
- Pipeline must keep working (ASR → alignment → MFA → merge is core product)
- No new dependencies
- Analysis before action — document everything before touching any code

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions Made

| Phase | Decision | Rationale |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| - | Use D:/Notes call graphs as foundation | Already generated, saves time |
| - | Regenerate method-level graphs for whole solution | Need complete coverage |
| - | Document FFmpeg code manually | Reflection/unsafe blocks not captured by generator |
| - | Keep UI.Avalonia dormant | Has future value, not currently blocking |
| - | Defer test updates | Fix after reorganization is complete |
